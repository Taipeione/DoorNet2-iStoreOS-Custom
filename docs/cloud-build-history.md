# DoorNet2-V0.1 cloud build history

This record describes only GitHub-hosted Actions runs from the newly created
public repository. Local checks are not firmware-build evidence.

| [#1](https://github.com/Taipeione/DoorNet2-iStoreOS-Custom/actions/runs/39097977668) | `2a7cb1ceeee2533918d4cecd208c65baab1047cd` | FAIL before downloads or compilation | Feed installation completed, but the first `make defconfig` removed `luci-compat`; the build's immediate assertion stopped. Required roots were only supplied before the first normalization. The replacement flow re-applies required roots after feed-aware normalization, runs one final Kconfig pass, materializes the deterministic package-metadata closure, then rechecks it before downloads and compilation. No firmware artifact exists. |
